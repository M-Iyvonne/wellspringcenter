				<h4>Tom Query</h4>
				<p>I am an experienced counselor/ therapist with a first hand knowledge of a wide variety of issues, problems and situations.  I am excellent in communication, warm, relational, non-judgmental and direct.  I work to hear the issues you are seeking help with. I do not use "psychobabble."</p> 

				<p>I focus on the "here and now" issues you bring and we will explore what has brought you to this place, what you can do and/or what you can be.</p>

				<p>I focus on a person's/couple's strengths, not their weaknesses.  I do not hesitate to be direct; however, I am welcoming and sensitive to diversity - particularly in faith and spiritual beliefs; race; sexuality; gender; life history choices and family of origin experiences.</p>

				<h4>AnnaLisa Derenthal</h4>

				<p>Haunted by past events, consumed by fear, pain, guilt or sadness? I have helped others like you end suffering and overcome fears, finally putting their pasts behind them.  I am experienced with grief/loss, panic and anxiety disorders, phobias, depression and low self esteem.</p> 

				<p>I also work extensively with LGBTQI and Gender Identity issues, and I help transgender people through the transitioning process.</p> 

				<p>I am open-minded and accepting of all lifestyles and welcome folks from any spiritual belief system, sexual orientations, colors, shapes and sizes.</p>

				<h4>Anna Baxter</h4>

				<p>I am passionate about providing a safe space for exploring fear, pain, sadness, conflict, stress, and/or confusion.</p>  

				<p>I am naturally empathic and have a warm, friendly disposition.  I truly believe that we all have the power to change the world with our passion, our dreams, and our smiling faces. </p>

				<p>I see individuals, couples, poly units and families to find their innate potential and achieve their dreams, regardless of gender, orientation, race, religion, or love-style.</p>

				<h4>Melissa Dickinson<h4>

					<p>I view therapy as an opportunity to develop a healthy relationship where you can grow and explore new opportunities without judgement.</p>

					<p> My preference is to keep therapy "label-free", so that we can collaborate on making real progress on the issues standing between you and the life you desire. My space is informal and friendly (I'm a jeans and t-shirt kind of therapist), with the occasional four-legged friend to greet you. </p> 

					<p>It is my honor to work with a diverse clientele (i.e. ethnicity, gender, sexuality, spirituality, LGBTIQ, etc). I have specialized training in gender and sexuality issues via AASECT and am kink-aware/friendly. </p>

				<h4>Cheryll Thompson</h4>

					<p>I believe in creating a therapeutic relationship based on compassion, respect, non-judgment and total acceptance of the unique individual you are.  I provide a supportive, safe, healing environment.  I provide individual and couples counseling and seminars aimed at helping to create a more fulfilled life.</p> 

					<p>As my client, you will increase your self-awareness , gain self-confidence and be empowered to make decisions that positively impact your relationships, career, finances, health and ultimately your life. </p>

					<p>I bring my experiences, a multi-cultural worldview, a unique perspective born from my Jamaican heritage and my open heart.  </p>
